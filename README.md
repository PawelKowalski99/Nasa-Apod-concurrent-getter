## Solution description

### Used external dependencies
* go-chi - small http router, which is fast and easy to use.
   * Additionally, I used middleware request throttle to limit and add to queue requesters
* go-chi/render - served me as an easy response renderer to json
* gjson - Served me as easy to use json key-value getter for query filtering
* storj.io/common - provided me a limiter struct to have concurrency
